\section{Introduction}

Boasting over 700 million visits since its opening in 1955 \cite{disneyland}, Disneyland is undeniably a special place for many people around the world. Located in Southern California's Orange County, in the City of Anaheim, Disneyland must deal with significant environmental factors including extreme drought, wildfires, and urban heat to remain a top tourist destination.

In this book, you will be able to identify several microclimates across Disneyland Resort. These microclimates will be defined using the following criteria:

- Soil composition

- Vegetation (type and quantities)

- Urban Heat Island Index (UHII)

- Humidity

- Solar aspect
 
- Water features (human-made)

- Water features (natural)
