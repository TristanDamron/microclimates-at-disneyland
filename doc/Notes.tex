\section{Research Questions}

1. How many distinct microclimates (larger than 100 square meters) can be identified across the Disneyland resort? Microclimates will be classified using several factors:

- Soil composition

- Vegetation (type and quantities)

- UHII

- Humidity

- Solar aspect
 
- Water features (human-made)

- Water features (natural)


\section{California EPA UHII}

In 2015, the California Environmental Protection Agency adopted the Urban Heat Island Index to identify urban heat islands across the state. This score takes into account several factors which contribute to rising temperatures in urban areas including vegetation, heat-producing activities, and dark pavement.
